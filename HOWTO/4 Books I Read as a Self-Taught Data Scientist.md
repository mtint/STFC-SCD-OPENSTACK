Data science is a field many people have been talking about in the past years. Data scientists have been even called “the sexiest job of the 21st century,” however, there are many gray areas that make aspiring data scientists uncertain about what they need to learn to become data scientists.

This is why I have made a list of books I read when I was getting into data science. I recommend you read them if you’ve been dabbling in data science and would like to learn from scratch. Also, the books are great for those with some previous knowledge of programming languages, statistics, or math and would like to know how that knowledge can be used in the data science field.

“Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python” by Joel Grus
======================================================================

This book aims to help you develop the hacking skills necessary to get started doing data science. After reading the book, you’d be comfortable with the maths and statistics that are at the core of data science. Although there’s a chapter in this book called “A Crash Course in Python,” the book’s goal is not to teach you Python from scratch, so, in case you never wrote code in Python, you should supplement this book with [one of my recommended Python books](https://betterprogramming.pub/4-python-books-i-read-as-a-self-taught-programmer-5a5453840cdb).

The book is packed with topics that every data scientist should be familiar with in the fields of statistics (probability, hypothesis, and inference), linear algebra (vectors and matrices), and machine learning (theory and concepts behind machine learning models).

Keep in mind that the book mostly gives an overview of the topics mentioned before; however, to be a good data scientist, you should know much more about those topics, so after reading this book consider reading the books listed below in no particular order.

“Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts” by Peter Bruce and Andrew Bruce

This book is great for those with some familiarity with the R or Python programming language and with some prior exposure to statistics. By reading the book, you’ll learn which concepts are important and useful from a data science perspective.

I would describe “Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts” as a beginner-friendly book rather than an in-depth book though. In most chapters, you can expect a walkthrough of many statistical concepts you should know for data science such as p-values, hypothesis testing, t-tests, regressions, sampling techniques, and more with code snippets written in Python and R.

It’s definitely a must-read for programmers that want to learn statistics for data science.

“Build a Career in Data Science” by Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis
=======================================================================

Unlike all the books listed in this article, “Build a Career in Data Science*”* mainly focuses on helping you enter the field of data science and grow your career in it.

This book is great for aspiring data scientists who haven’t entered the field of data science yet and would like to learn the skills needed to become a data scientist, as well as people who are in the first years of the role and would like to become more senior.

The book is split into four parts. The first part is an overview of data science where the authors describe the role of a data scientist and the skills you need to become a data scientist. The second part aims to help you find your data science job, while the third and fourth parts walk you through the first months on the job and how to grow in your data science career respectively.

“Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to successful data science projects using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn” by Stephen Klosterman
===========================================================================================================================================================

This book will help you develop the programming skills needed in data science with an end-to-end project split into practical exercises. Each exercise corresponds to steps followed in data science projects that will help you learn Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn using realistic data.

By reading the book you’ll learn the fundamental steps to complete a data science project in Python, such as data cleaning, data exploration, model building, and evaluation. Also, the book will not only show the code to make a machine learning algorithm but also explain how the algorithms work and make predictions.

Some of the requisites to reading this book are a basic experience of programming with Python or another similar language and statistics.

Bonus: “Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron
==========================================================================================

The previous books listed will only give you a gentle introduction to advanced data science topics like machine learning; however, if you’d like to read an in-depth book on machine learning, you should consider reading “Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow.”

As the name suggests, the book focuses on three machine learning libraries that are used by data scientists, so you should have a reasonable understanding of college-level math (calculus, linear algebra, probabilities, and statistics). Also, before reading the book, make sure you’re familiar with Python’s main scientific libraries (NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib).

I’m reading this book now, and I would recommend you read it only if you have a solid knowledge of Python, statistics, and math.
