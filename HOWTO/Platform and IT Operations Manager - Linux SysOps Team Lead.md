**About Clearmatics**

Clearmatics' mission is to build peer-to-peer infrastructure for a machine-driven future that is resistant to the monopoly-making tendencies of network effects inherent in today's client-server architectures. We call our technology approach 'decentralized automation', which combines cryptography, consensus protocols and economic mechanism design.

We are a Blockchain R&D company and have good ties to the Open Source / Ethereum community.

Our stack is Ethereum-like, so familiarity and passion with the space is key. Some of the areas we tackle include scalability through cryptography (zkSNARKs, multiparty computation, private transactions/assets), protocol design (e.g. proof relays/pegs), formally verified smart contracts, and type-safe & performant distributed virtual machine architectures.

The **Platform and IT Operations Manager** is responsible for Clearmatics' IT infrastructure, comprising internally used SaaS products and externally facing highly distributed blockchain networks. You will utilize your infrastructure and operational experience to help develop, implement and run a world class support function for Clearmatics' Autonity testnets and upcoming Mainnet. 

International candidates are accepted and very welcome, as Clearmatics operates on a 'remote first' model.
