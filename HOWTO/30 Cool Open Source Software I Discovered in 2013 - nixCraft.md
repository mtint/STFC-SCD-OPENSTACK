[The FreeBSD jail](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-setup-freebsd-jail-with-ezjail/) provides an operating system-level virtualization partition a FreeBSD-based serve into several independent mini-systems. You can do the [same with Linux using OpenVZ](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/openvz-rhel-centos-linux-tutorial/). Linux Containers (LXC) is a virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems. Docker extends LXC. It uses LXC, cgroups, Linux kernel and other parts to automate the deployment of applications inside software containers. It comes with API to runs processes in isolation. With docker I can pack WordPress (or any other app written in Python/Ruby/Php & friends) and its dependencies in a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container. I can deploy and test such container on any Linux based server.

\#10 Jekyll – Create simple static blog
---------------------------------------

Drupal, Typo3, WordPress and many other content management system (CMS)/blogging software dynamically create feature rich content. However, you may not need all the all features and complexity offered by modern CMS based systems. For example, a [WordPress based blog like nixCraft](https://www.cyberciti.biz/) requires [multiple VMs](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/run-different-network-services-on-separate-vm-systems.html), [CDN for static assets](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/wordpress-cdn-content-delivery-network-configuration.html), [caching engine such as memcached](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-install-memcached-under-rhel-fedora-centos/), PHP, mysql database, comment moderation, and on going updates. A growing trend is to keep your blog simple by avoiding CMS and use static HTML generators that offers the following benefits:

* No more complex setups i.e. no databases/php/caching engines required.
* No more comment moderation.
* Pesky updates.
* Static files are more secure.
* Easy to scale or cache on edge/CDN nodes.
