In the Horizon web interface provided that you have a pretty recent version of Horizon, i.e. \>= Grizzly: [Change security group][1]:

\> It's possible to change the security groups on the fly using Horizon,

\> if you're using the latest release Grizzly. Click on the "More" button

\> for the instance you want to update and you should see an "Edit

\> Security Groups" option.

\> 

\> In the CLI, use nova help [add-secgroup][2]

\> 

\> The code for this was added a year ago so I believe this should be

\> available in Folsom.
