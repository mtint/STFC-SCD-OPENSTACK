 ** 1 ** **Set up backup and settings** 
----------------------------------------

Click Add backup from the main Duplicati page. Leave ‘Configure a new backup’ selected and click Next. Give your backup a name and provide a longer description (say a list of folders or items). Choose your encryption option – the default AES-256 built-in option is best for most – and then enter a strong password with the aid of your password manager. Click Next.

 ** 2 ** **Choose your cloud destination** 
-------------------------------------------

 By default, your computer is chosen as the place to save your files – click the ‘Storage Type’ drop-down menu to reveal all available remote options, from standards like FTP/SFTP, WebDAV and OpenStack to cloud providers from Dropbox to Google Drive. After selecting your type, click the AuthID box to follow the prompts to link Duplicati to your remote storage account.

 ** 3 ** **Select what to back up** 
------------------------------------

 After the AuthID code has been generated and copied into the box, you need to enter the path on your server – for example, **/duplicati/** – and then click Test Connection, creating the folder when prompted. Click Next to use the file picker to select which folder(s) to include in your backup – the annotation helps you pick and choose what to include (and leave out). Click Next.

 ** 4 ** **Pick a schedule** 
-----------------------------

 By default, a daily schedule is set for updating your backups. You can make changes here using the ‘Run again every’ section – anything from minutes to years can be set. Click Next when done. Leave the Remote volume size alone, choose whether to keep all backup versions or set a limit (the smart option is probably best). Finish by clicking Save. ■
